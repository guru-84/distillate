Don't listen too much to those who tell you
what to do and what not to do, do what you
feel like doing

Don't do what you think others want you to
do. Perhaps ask, talk about it, but
eventually do what you feel like doing

Don't do to others what you don't want done
to you, but if you feel like it, do what
someone asks you to do

Do to others what you want to be done to
you, but don't do to someone what they
don't want done to them

Don't worry too much about what others may
think of you

Do if you don't want to have regrets, and
have no remorse if you follow these
principles
